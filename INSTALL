## Description: installation instructions

(0) Required software:
    I've tested this on Ruby 1.8.7.
    I've tested this on Ubuntu 9-ish
    It expects that the standard unix utilities
      'cat', 'diff', 'gzip', 'tar' are installed.
        (assume that tar accepts the -j (bzip2) and --remove-files flag.)
    If you wish to handle CAPTCHAs
      (i.e. with CAPTCHA_USER_TIMEOUT>0),
      then you need an image viewer.  By default,
      the command is 'eog'.  Look at the
      option IMAGE_VIEWER_APP in config-advanced.rb

(1) Get all of the source into a single directory.

(2) (Optional) Edit config-simple.rb, config-advanced.rb

(3) Set a username, password.

  The bot looks for a file named DB_DIR/passwords.rb (DB_DIR is a constant defined in config-simple.rb)

  This file should contain three lines:
    BOT_USERNAME = the wikipedia username for the bot account.
    BOT_PASSWORD = the password for the bot account.
    OPERATOR_USERNAME = the wikipedia username of the bot's operator.

(3) You must create a few pages in the Bot's User space:

    User:#{BOT_USERNAME}/Bot/Shutdown
 
    User:#{BOT_USERNAME}/Bot/Madlibs/2/Hello
    User:#{BOT_USERNAME}/Bot/Madlibs/2/Revision
    User:#{BOT_USERNAME}/Bot/Madlibs/2/Link
    User:#{BOT_USERNAME}/Bot/Madlibs/2/EndRevision
    User:#{BOT_USERNAME}/Bot/Madlibs/2/Goodbye
    User:#{BOT_USERNAME}/Bot/Madlibs/2/OptOut

  (the Madlibs are pieces of the messages sent to
   users.  Look under user BlevintronBot for examples)

(4) Start the bot: ./wiki-badlink-bot.rb

  You might need to chmod +x wiki-badlink-bot.rb

(5) Wait a long time.

  The bot will scrape and check links for about five days before it even tries
  to perform an edit.

(6) To shut the bot down: hit CTRL-C or send it SIGINT.

  The bot will try to shutdown cleanly... This should
  take less than 30 seconds.
